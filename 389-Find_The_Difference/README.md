# 389. Find The Difference

LeetCode Problem Link: <https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/>

## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Solution Thoughts

### Observations and logic

- A simple count of characters would solve the problem: the extra character will be the only difference between the two counts
- Another approach can use bit-wise XOR. Any number XOR with itself give 0, so if we perform XOR on all the characters in the two strings, we will get the extra character

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters

## Examples

### Example 1

> **Input**: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
>
> **Output**: "e"
>
> **Explanation**: 'e' is the letter that was added.

### Example 2

> **Input**: s = "", t = "y"
>
> **Output**: "y"
